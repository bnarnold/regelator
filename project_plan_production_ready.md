### Story 1.1: Code Organization and Module Structure ‚úÖ
**Goal:** Restructure monolithic handlers and models into logical submodules for better maintainability and team development

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Split handlers.rs (1,234 lines) into domain-specific modules (web, quiz, admin)
- [x] Split models.rs (505 lines) into domain-specific modules (core, quiz, admin)  
- [x] Create proper module hierarchy with re-exports for backward compatibility
- [x] Update all imports and ensure compilation and tests pass
- [x] Maintain all existing functionality while improving code organization

**Implementation Completed:**
- **Handlers Structure**: Split into `handlers/web.rs`, `handlers/quiz.rs`, `handlers/admin.rs`
  - Web handlers: Rule browsing, definitions, navigation (275 lines)
  - Quiz handlers: Sessions, questions, scoring, completion (261 lines) 
  - Admin handlers: Authentication, dashboard, password management (234 lines)
- **Models Structure**: Split into `models/core.rs`, `models/quiz.rs`, `models/admin.rs`
  - Core models: Rules, versions, content, glossary (193 lines)
  - Quiz models: Questions, answers, attempts, statistics (252 lines)
  - Admin models: Authentication and user management (25 lines)

### Story 1.2: Admin Authentication System Unification ‚úÖ
**Goal:** Eliminate code duplication in admin authentication and provide useful admin context to handlers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create AdminToken extractor containing admin user information (username, admin_id)
- [x] Replace duplicated authentication logic in 8+ admin handlers
- [x] Implement proper HTTP status codes (401) for authentication failures
- [x] Provide admin context directly to handlers without additional lookups
- [x] Maintain existing functionality while improving code maintainability
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for authentication edge cases

**Current Problem:**
- Authentication logic duplicated across admin handlers (~6 lines per handler)
- Inconsistent error handling and status codes
- Risk of missing authentication checks in new admin endpoints
- Handlers need to re-extract user info after authentication

**Technical Implementation:**
- **AdminToken Struct**: Contains `username`, `admin_id`, and other admin claims
- **Extractor Implementation**: Implements `FromRequestParts` with JWT verification
- **Compile-time Safety**: Handler signatures require AdminToken parameter

- **Centralized Auth Logic**: Move JWT verification into extractor implementation
- **Clean Handlers**: Remove duplicated authentication and context extraction

**Security Benefits:**
- **Impossible to Forget**: Compilation fails if admin handler lacks authentication
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized authentication failure responses  
- **Audit Trail Ready**: Admin context available for logging actions
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Centralized authentication logic easier to audit

**Development Benefits:**
- **Code Maintainability**: Single source of truth for admin authentication
