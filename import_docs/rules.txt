1. spirit-of-game Spirit of the Game
1.1. spirit-self-officiated Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated sport. All players are responsible for administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair [play](definition:play) on every [player](definition:player).
1.2. spirit-no-intentional-breach It is trusted that no [player](definition:player) will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent breaches, but rather a method for resuming [play](definition:play) in a manner which simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach.
1.2.1. spirit-egregious-breach-captains If there is a deliberate or egregious breach of the rules or Spirit of the Game, the captains should discuss this and determine an appropriate outcome, even if that outcome is not in accordance with a specific rule.
1.3. spirit-players-as-referees Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration between teams. Players must:
1.3.1. spirit-know-rules know and abide by both the rules and the spirit of the rules;
1.3.2. spirit-fair-objective be fair-minded and objective;
1.3.3. spirit-truthful be truthful;
1.3.4. spirit-explain-clearly explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;
1.3.5. spirit-allow-opponents-speak allow opponents an opportunity to speak;
1.3.6. spirit-listen-consider listen to and consider opponent's viewpoint;
1.3.7. spirit-respectful-language use respectful words and body language with consideration of potential cultural differences;
1.3.8. spirit-resolve-efficiently resolve disputes efficiently;
1.3.9. spirit-consistent-calls make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game; and
1.3.10. spirit-significant-calls-only only make a [call](definition:call) where a breach is significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the action, or where a [player's](definition:player) safety is at risk.
1.4. spirit-competitive-respect Highly competitive [play](definition:play) is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, [player](definition:player) safety or the basic joy of [play](definition:play).
1.5. spirit-good-examples The following actions are some examples of good Spirit:
1.5.1. spirit-retract-call retracting a [call](definition:call) when you no longer believe the [call](definition:call) was correct;
1.5.2. spirit-check-opponent checking in with an opponent on the sideline after a contentious interaction;
1.5.3. spirit-compliment-opponent complimenting an opponent for good [play](definition:play) or Spirit;
1.5.4. spirit-introduce-yourself introducing yourself to your opponent; and
1.5.5. spirit-react-calmly reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.
1.6. spirit-violations The following actions are clear violations of the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided:
1.6.1. spirit-dangerous-aggressive dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;
1.6.2. spirit-intentional-fouls intentional fouling or other intentional rule breaches;
1.6.3. spirit-taunting-intimidating taunting or intimidating opposing players;
1.6.4. spirit-disrespectful-celebrating celebrating disrespectfully after scoring;
1.6.5. spirit-retaliatory-calls making calls in retaliation to an opponent's [call](definition:call);
1.6.6. spirit-call-for-pass calling for a pass from an opposition [player](definition:player); and
1.6.7. spirit-win-at-all-costs other win-at-all-costs behaviour.
1.7. spirit-team-guardians Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:
1.7.1. spirit-teach-rules take responsibility for teaching their team the rules and good Spirit;
1.7.2. spirit-discipline-teammates discipline team-mates who display poor Spirit;
1.7.3. spirit-provide-feedback provide constructive feedback to other teams about what they are doing well and/or how to improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game; and
1.7.4. spirit-stoppage-call call a [Spirit Stoppage](definition:spirit-stoppage) to address Spirit issues, as appropriate.
1.8. spirit-assist-novice In the case where a novice [player](definition:player) is involved in a breach and does not know the rules, experienced players should assist to explain the breach.
1.9. spirit-supervise-beginners An experienced [player](definition:player), who offers advice on rules and guides on-field arbitration, may supervise games involving beginners or younger players.
1.10. spirit-involved-players-discuss Calls should be discussed by the players directly involved in the [play](definition:play), and by players who had the [best perspective](definition:best-perspective).
1.10.1. spirit-teammate-incorrect-call If a [player](definition:player) who was not directly involved believes that a team-mate has made an incorrect [call](definition:call), or caused a foul or violation, they should inform their team-mate.
1.10.2. spirit-non-players-refrain [Non-players](definition:non-player), apart from the captains, should refrain from getting involved. However players may seek other peoples' perspectives to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the appropriate [call](definition:call).
1.11. spirit-players-captains-responsible Players and captains are solely responsible for making and resolving all calls.
1.12. spirit-cannot-agree If after discussion players cannot agree, or it is not clear and obvious:
1.12.1. spirit-what-occurred what occurred in a [play](definition:play), or
1.12.2. spirit-what-would-have-occurred what would most likely have occurred in a [play](definition:play),
the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed [thrower](definition:thrower).
2. field-definition [Playing Field](definition:playing-field)
2.1. field-rectangular-dimensions The [playing field](definition:playing-field) is a rectangular area with dimensions and zones as shown on Figure 1 (see above) and should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable [player](definition:player) safety.
2.2. field-perimeter-lines The [perimeter lines](definition:perimeter-lines) surround the [playing field](definition:playing-field) and consist of two (2) sidelines along the length and two (2) endlines along the width.
2.3. field-perimeter-not-playing The [perimeter lines](definition:perimeter-lines) are not part of the [playing field](definition:playing-field).
2.4. field-goal-lines The [goal lines](definition:goal-line) are the lines that separate the [central zone](definition:central-zone) from the [end zones](definition:end-zone) and are part of the [central zone](definition:central-zone).
2.5. field-brick-marks The brick marks are the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1) metre lines in the [central zone](definition:central-zone), located a distance equal to the length of the [end zone](definition:end-zone) away from each [goal line](definition:goal-line), midway between the sidelines.
2.6. field-corner-markers Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones) mark the corners of the [central zone](definition:central-zone) and the [end zones](definition:end-zone).
2.7. field-clear-surroundings The immediate surroundings of the [playing field](definition:playing-field) shall be kept clear of movable objects. If [play](definition:play) is obstructed by [non-players](definition:non-player) or objects within three (3) metres of the [perimeter line](definition:perimeter-lines), any obstructed [player](definition:player) or [thrower](definition:thrower) in possession may call "Violation".
3. equipment-definition Equipment
3.1. equipment-disc-acceptable Any flying disc acceptable to both captains may be used.
3.2. equipment-approved-list WFDF may maintain a list of approved discs recommended for use.
3.3. equipment-uniform-distinguishing Each [player](definition:player) must wear a uniform that distinguishes their team.

4.1. game-consists-points A game consists of a number of points. Each point ends with the scoring of a goal.
4.2. game-winning-score A game is finished and won by the first team to score fifteen (15) goals.
4.3. game-halves A game is separated into two (2) periods of [play](definition:play), called halves. Half time occurs when a team first scores eight (8) goals.
4.4. game-first-point The first point of each half starts when the half starts.

5.3. teams-substitutions A team may make unlimited substitutions after a goal is scored and before their team signals readiness for the [pull](definition:pull).
5.4. teams-mixed-ratio For Mixed games, a form of an alternating 4:3 personnel ratio should be used.
6. starting-game Starting a Game
6.1. starting-choose-options Representatives of the two teams fairly determine which team first chooses either:
6.1.1. starting-receive-or-throw whether to receive or [throw](definition:throw) the initial [pull](definition:pull); or
6.1.2. starting-defend-end which [end zone](definition:end-zone) they will initially defend.
6.2. starting-remaining-choice The other team is given the remaining choice.
6.3. starting-second-half-switch At the start of the second half, these initial selections are switched.
6.4. starting-mixed-strategies For Mixed games, teams should discuss any strategies to make personnel match-ups easier to identify.
7. pull-definition The [Pull](definition:pull)
7.1. pull-starts-play At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, [play](definition:play) commences with a [throw](definition:throw) by the defence, called a "[pull](definition:pull)".
7.1.1. pull-prepare-without-delay Teams must prepare for the [pull](definition:pull) without unreasonable delay.
7.2. pull-readiness-signal The [pull](definition:pull) may be made only after both teams have signalled their readiness by having the puller and a [player](definition:player) on offence raise a hand above their head.
7.3. pull-offense-goal-line After signalling readiness all [offensive players](definition:offensive-player) must stand with one foot on their defending [goal line](definition:goal-line) without changing location relative to one another until the [pull](definition:pull) is released.
7.4. pull-defense-behind-line After signalling readiness all [defensive players](definition:defensive-player) must keep their feet entirely behind the vertical plane of the [goal line](definition:goal-line) until the [pull](definition:pull) is released.
7.5. pull-false-start-offside If a team breaches 7.3 ("false start") or 7.4 ("offside") the opposing team may call the relevant violation. This must be called before the offence touches the disc (7.8 still applies).
7.5.1. pull-false-start-call If the defence chooses to call a false start, the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point as per 7.9, 7.10, 7.11, or 7.12 and then [play](definition:play) restarts as soon as possible as if a time-out had been called at that location.
7.5.2. pull-offside-call If the offence chooses to call offside, they must let the disc hit the [ground](definition:ground) untouched and then resume [play](definition:play) as if a brick has been called (no check is required).
7.6. pull-players-move After the [pull](definition:pull) is released, all players may move in any direction.
7.7. pull-defense-no-touch No [player](definition:player) on the defensive team may touch the disc after a [pull](definition:pull) until a member of the offensive team contacts the disc or the disc hits the [ground](definition:ground).
7.8. pull-offense-touch-turnover If an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player), in-bounds or [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), touches the disc before it hits the [ground](definition:ground), and the offensive team fails to subsequently establish [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), that is a [turnover](definition:turnover) (a "dropped pull").
7.9. pull-caught-pivot If an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) catches the [pull](definition:pull) and subsequently establishes [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), they must establish a pivot point at the location on the [playing field](definition:playing-field) nearest to where [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) is established, even if that pivot point is in their [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone).
7.10. pull-lands-stays-in If the disc initially contacts the [playing field](definition:playing-field) and never becomes [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point where the disc stops, even if that pivot point is in their [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone).
7.11. pull-lands-rolls-out If the disc initially contacts the [playing field](definition:playing-field) and then becomes [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) without contacting an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player), the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the [perimeter line](definition:perimeter-lines), or the nearest location in the [central zone](definition:central-zone) if that pivot point would be in their [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone).
7.11.1. pull-lands-touched-out If the disc does contact an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) before it becomes [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the [perimeter line](definition:perimeter-lines), even if that pivot point is in their [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone).
7.12. pull-lands-out-brick If the disc contacts the [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area without first touching the [playing field](definition:playing-field) or an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player), the [thrower](definition:thrower) may establish a pivot point either at the brick mark closest to their [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone), or at the location on the [central zone](definition:central-zone) closest to where the disc went [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) (Section 11.8). The binding brick option must be signalled before the disc is picked up. It must be signalled by any [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) fully extending one arm overhead, and they should call "brick".
8. state-of-play State of [Play](definition:play)
8.1. state-dead-play [Play](definition:play) is 'dead', and no [turnover](definition:turnover) is possible:
8.1.1. state-dead-after-start After the start of a point, until the [pull](definition:pull) is released;
8.1.2. state-dead-pivot-location When the disc must be carried to the [pivot location](definition:pivot-location) after the [pull](definition:pull) or a [turnover](definition:turnover), until a pivot point is established;
8.1.3. state-dead-after-call After a [call](definition:call) which stops the [play](definition:play) or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked in; or
8.1.4. state-dead-after-ground After a disc hits the [ground](definition:ground), until [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) is established by the appropriate team.
8.1.5. state-dead-movement-allowed Players are allowed to move during dead [play](definition:play) (unless specified otherwise).
8.2. state-live-play [Play](definition:play) that is not dead is "live".

8.4. state-stop-rolling-disc Any [player](definition:player) may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the [ground](definition:ground).
8.4.1. state-alter-disc-position If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a [player](definition:player) significantly alters the disc's position, the opposition may request that the pivot point be established at the location where the disc was contacted
8.5. state-retrieve-disc-walking After a [turnover](definition:turnover), and after the [pull](definition:pull), an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) must move at walking pace or faster to directly retrieve the disc and establish a pivot point.
8.5.1. state-time-limits-pivot In addition to 8.5, after a [turnover](definition:turnover) the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point within the following time limits, if the disc did not become [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), and the disc's location is:
8.5.1.1. state-central-zone-ten-seconds in the [central zone](definition:central-zone) – within ten (10) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
8.5.1.2. state-end-zone-twenty-seconds in an [end zone](definition:end-zone) – within twenty (20) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
8.5.2. state-delay-warning-violation If the offence breaches 8.5, or 8.5.1, the defence may give a warning ("Delay of Game" or using a [pre-stall](definition:pre-stall) for breaches of 8.5.1) or may call a "Violation".
8.5.2.1. state-continue-breach-stall If, after a warning, the offence continues to breach 8.5, or 8.5.1, then 9.3.1 does not apply and the [marker](definition:marker) may commence the stall count.
8.5.3. state-defense-no-obstruct The defence must not move in a manner that obstructs the offence from taking [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) or establishing a pivot point.
8.5.4. state-pivot-location-disagreement If players cannot agree on the correct [pivot location](definition:pivot-location), the relevant midpoint between the two proposed pivot locations must be used.
9. stall-count Stall Count
9.1. stall-count-administration The [marker](definition:marker) administers a stall count on the [thrower](definition:thrower) by announcing "Stalling" and then counting from one (1) to ten (10). The interval between the start of each number in the stall count must be at least one (1) second.
9.2. stall-count-communication The stall count must be clearly communicated to the [thrower](definition:thrower).
9.3. stall-count-conditions The [marker](definition:marker) may only start and continue a stall count when:
9.3.1. stall-count-live-play [Play](definition:play) is live, or once a pivot point is established after a [turnover](definition:turnover);
9.3.2. stall-count-three-metres They are within three (3) metres of the [thrower's](definition:thrower) pivot point, or the [pivot location](definition:pivot-location) if the [thrower](definition:thrower) is not at that location; and
9.3.3. stall-count-legal-positioning All defenders are legally positioned (Section 18.1).
9.4. stall-count-marker-change If the [marker](definition:marker) moves beyond the appropriate three (3) metre radius, or a different [player](definition:player) becomes the [marker](definition:marker), the stall count must be restarted at "Stalling one (1)".
9.5. stall-count-restart-rules After a [stoppage in play](definition:stoppage-of-play) the stall count is resumed as follows:
9.5.1. stall-count-defense-breach After an accepted breach by the defence the stall count restarts at "Stalling one (1)".
9.5.2. stall-count-offense-breach After an accepted breach by the offence the stall count restarts at maximum nine (9).
9.5.3. stall-count-contested-stall After a contested stall-out the stall count restarts at "Stalling eight (8)".
9.5.4. stall-count-continuation-play After continuation of [play](definition:play) in accordance with rule 16.3.2 the stall count restarts at "Stalling one (1)".
9.5.5. stall-count-other-calls After all other calls, including "pick", the stall count restarts at maximum six (6). However:
9.5.5.1. stall-count-thrower-receiving-breach If there is a [call](definition:call) involving the [thrower](definition:thrower), and a separate receiving breach, and the disc is returned to the [thrower](definition:thrower), the stall count is resumed based on the outcome of the [call](definition:call) involving the [thrower](definition:thrower).
9.5.5.2. stall-count-check-violation If there is a violation called related to The Check (Section 10), the stall count resumes at the same count that was determined prior to that violation.
9.6. stall-count-maximum-meaning To restart a stall count "at maximum n", where "n" is determined by 9.5.2, 9.5.5, or 20.3.6, means the following:
9.6.1. stall-count-calculation If "x" is the last agreed number fully uttered prior to the [call](definition:call), then the stall count resumes at "Stalling (x plus one)" or "Stalling n", whichever of those two numbers is lower.
10. check-definition The Check
10.1. check-restart-play Whenever [play](definition:play) stops during a point for a foul, violation, contested [turnover](definition:turnover), specified [turnover](definition:turnover), contested goal, stoppage, discussion, or at the completion of a time-out, [play](definition:play) must restart as quickly as possible with a check. The check may only be delayed for the discussion of a [call](definition:call).
10.2. check-player-positioning [Player](definition:player) positioning after a [call](definition:call) (except in the case of a time-out, and unless specified otherwise):
10.2.1. check-before-pass-thrown If [play](definition:play) stops before a pass is thrown, all players must return to the location they held when the [call](definition:call) was made.
10.2.2. check-after-pass-thrown If [play](definition:play) stops after a pass is thrown, then:
10.2.2.1. check-disc-returned-thrower if the disc is returned to the [thrower](definition:thrower), all players must return to the location they held when the [thrower](definition:thrower) released the pass, or the time of the [call](definition:call), whichever is earlier.
10.2.2.2. check-play-stands if the result of the [play](definition:play) stands all players must return to the location they held when either a [player](definition:player) established [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), or the disc hit the [ground](definition:ground).
10.2.2.3. check-other-player-possession if a [player](definition:player) other than the [thrower](definition:thrower) gains [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) as a result of an accepted breach, all players must return to the location they held when the breach occurred.
10.2.3. check-remain-stationary All players must remain stationary in that location until the disc is checked in.
10.3. check-equipment-fix Any [player](definition:player) may briefly extend a [stoppage of play](definition:stoppage-of-play) to fix faulty equipment ("equipment"), but active [play](definition:play) may not be stopped for this purpose.
10.4. check-verify-readiness Prior to the check the person checking the disc in, and the nearest opposition [player](definition:player), must verify that their own team-mates are ready, and positioned as per 10.2.
10.5. check-delay-warning If there is an unnecessary delay in checking the disc in, the opposition may give a warning ("Delay of Game"). If the delay continues, the team that gave the warning may check the disc in by calling "Disc In", without verification from the opposition, but only if the team checking the disc in are all stationary, and positioned as per 10.2.
10.6. check-restart-procedures To restart [play](definition:play) with a check:
10.6.1. check-thrower-has-disc when the [thrower](definition:thrower) has the disc:
10.6.1.1. check-defender-within-reach if there is a defender within reach, the defender must touch the disc.
10.6.1.2. check-no-defender-reach if there is not a defender within reach, the [thrower](definition:thrower) must touch the disc to the [ground](definition:ground) and may call "Disc In".
10.6.2. check-disc-on-ground when the disc is on the [ground](definition:ground), the defender nearest to the disc must call "Disc In".
10.7. check-violation-call A [player](definition:player) may call a violation regarding the check if an opponent:
10.7.1. check-pass-without-check attempts a pass without an appropriate check as per 10.6; or
10.7.2. check-restart-without-verification restarts [play](definition:play) without verification from their nearest opposition [player](definition:player); or
10.7.3. check-moving-before is moving immediately prior to the check; or
10.7.4. check-inappropriate-position was not in the appropriate position.
10.7.5. check-violation-consequences After this violation [call](definition:call) any pass does not count regardless of whether it is complete or incomplete, and [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) reverts back to the [thrower](definition:thrower) (unless 16.3 applies).
11. out-of-bounds [Out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob)
11.1. out-of-bounds-definition The entire [playing field](definition:playing-field) is in-bounds. The [perimeter lines](definition:perimeter-lines) are not part of the [playing field](definition:playing-field) and are [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob). All [non-players](definition:non-player) are part of the [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area.
11.2. out-of-bounds-area The [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area consists of the [ground](definition:ground) which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it, except for [defensive players](definition:defensive-player), who are always considered "in-bounds".
11.3. out-of-bounds-offensive-player An [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) who is not [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) is in-bounds.
11.3.1. out-of-bounds-airborne-status An airborne [player](definition:player) retains their in-bounds/[out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) status until that [player](definition:player) contacts the [playing field](definition:playing-field) or the [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area.
11.3.2. out-of-bounds-catch-contact A [player](definition:player) who has caught the disc, who contacts the [playing field](definition:playing-field) and then contacts an [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area, is still considered in-bounds, as long as they maintain the [catch](definition:catch) until they establish [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
11.3.2.1. out-of-bounds-leave-field If they leave the [playing field](definition:playing-field), they must establish a pivot point at the location on the [playing field](definition:playing-field) where they crossed the [perimeter line](definition:perimeter-lines) (unless 14.3 is in effect).
11.3.3. out-of-bounds-thrower-contact A [thrower](definition:thrower) who contacts an [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area is considered in-bounds until they make a pass.
11.3.4. out-of-bounds-player-contact Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) from one to another.
11.4. out-of-bounds-turnovers The following are [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) [turnovers](definition:turnover), and no [catch](definition:catch) is deemed to have occurred:
11.4.1. out-of-bounds-receiver-contact any part of an offensive receiver is [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) when they contact the disc; or
11.4.2. out-of-bounds-airborne-first-contact after catching the disc while airborne, an offensive receiver's first contact is [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) while still in contact with the disc.
11.5. out-of-bounds-disc-status A disc is in-bounds once [play](definition:play) is live, or when [play](definition:play) starts or restarts.
11.6. out-of-bounds-disc-becomes A disc becomes [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) when it first contacts the [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area or contacts an [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) [offensive player](definition:offensive-player). A disc that has been caught by an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) has the same in/[out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) status as that [player](definition:player). If the disc is simultaneously caught by more than one [offensive player](definition:offensive-player), one of them being [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), the disc is [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob).
11.7. out-of-bounds-disc-fly The disc may fly outside a [perimeter line](definition:perimeter-lines) and return to the [playing field](definition:playing-field), and players may go [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) to make a play on the disc.
11.8. out-of-bounds-location The place where a disc went [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) is the location where, prior to contacting an [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area or [player](definition:player), the disc was most recently:
11.8.1. out-of-bounds-over-field partly or wholly over the [playing field](definition:playing-field); or
11.8.2. out-of-bounds-contacted-player contacted by an in-bounds [player](definition:player).
11.9. out-of-bounds-non-player-retrieve If the disc is [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) and more than three (3) metres from the [pivot location](definition:pivot-location), [non-players](definition:non-player) may retrieve the disc. The [thrower](definition:thrower) must carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the [playing field](definition:playing-field).
12. receivers-positioning [Receivers](definition:receivers) and Positioning
12.1. receivers-catch-definition A "[catch](definition:catch)" occurs when a [player](definition:player) has a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts. A [catch](definition:catch) can enable a [player](definition:player) to establish [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
12.1.1. receivers-maintain-catch If the [player](definition:player) fails to maintain the [catch](definition:catch) due to subsequent [ground contact](definition:ground-contact) related to the [catch](definition:catch), or contact related to the [catch](definition:catch) with a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition [player](definition:player), [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) is deemed to have not occurred.
12.2. receivers-becomes-thrower After establishing [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), that [player](definition:player) becomes the [thrower](definition:thrower).
12.3. receivers-simultaneous-catch If offensive and defensive players [catch](definition:catch) the disc simultaneously, the offence retains [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
12.4. receivers-established-position A [player](definition:player) in an established position is entitled to remain in that position and must not be contacted by an opposing [player](definition:player).
12.5. receivers-occupy-position Every [player](definition:player) is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by any opposing [player](definition:player), provided that they do not initiate contact in taking such a position, and are not moving in a reckless or dangerously aggressive manner.
12.5.1. receivers-prevent-path However when the disc is in the air a [player](definition:player) may not move in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to make a play on the disc.
12.6. receivers-avoid-contact All players must attempt to avoid initiating contact with other players, and there is no situation where a [player](definition:player) may justify initiating contact. This includes avoiding initiating contact with a stationary opponent, or an opponent's expected position based on their established speed and direction.
12.6.1. receivers-play-disc-excuse "[Making a play on the disc](definition:making-a-play-on-the-disc)" is not a valid excuse for initiating contact with other players.
12.6.2. receivers-dive-leap-certain Before a [player](definition:player) dives, leaps or jumps away from their position, they must be reasonably certain they will not initiate contact with an opponent.
12.6.3. receivers-adjust-movements If a [player](definition:player) is not reasonably certain that they will be able to make a legal play at the disc before an opponent who is moving in a legal manner, they must adjust their movements to avoid initiating contact. If that adjustment is made, the result of the [play](definition:play) still stands.
12.7. receivers-initiate-contact The [player](definition:player) who initiates contact is deemed to be the [player](definition:player) who:
12.7.1. receivers-arrived-after arrived at the point of contact after the opponent had already established a [legitimate position](definition:legitimate-position) at that point (either a stationary or moving opponent), or
12.7.2. receivers-adjusted-movements adjusted their movements in a way that created unavoidable contact with an opponent moving in a legal manner, when taking into account all players' established position, speed and direction.
12.7.3. receivers-unclear-dive If it is unclear which [player](definition:player) initiated contact, and one of the players dived, leaped or jumped away from their position, that [player](definition:player) is deemed to have initiated contact.
12.8. receivers-minor-contact Some [minor contact](definition:minor-contact) may occur as two or more players move towards a single point simultaneously. [Minor contact](definition:minor-contact) should be minimized but is not considered a foul.
12.9. receivers-obstruct-movement Players may not use their extended arms or legs to obstruct the movement of opposing players.
12.10. receivers-no-assistance No [player](definition:player) may physically assist the movement of another [player](definition:player), nor use an item of equipment or object to assist in contacting the disc.
13. turnovers-definition [Turnovers](definition:turnover)
13.1. turnovers-transfer-possession A [turnover](definition:turnover) that transfers [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) from one team to the other occurs when:
13.1.1. turnovers-disc-ground the disc contacts the [ground](definition:ground) while it is not in the [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) of an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) (a "down");
13.1.1.1. turnovers-catch-before-ground however it is not "down" if a receiver catches a pass before the disc contacts the [ground](definition:ground), and maintains the [catch](definition:catch) while the disc is in contact with the [ground](definition:ground).
13.1.2. turnovers-defensive-possession a [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) establishes [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) of a pass (an "[interception](definition:interception)");
13.1.3. turnovers-out-of-bounds the disc becomes [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) (an "[out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob)" or "out"); or
13.1.4. turnovers-dropped-pull during the [pull](definition:pull), the offence touches the disc before it hits the [ground](definition:ground), and subsequently fails to establish [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) (a "dropped pull").
13.2. turnovers-stoppage A [turnover](definition:turnover) that transfers [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) from one team to the other, and results in a [stoppage of play](definition:stoppage-of-play), occurs when:
13.2.1. turnovers-offensive-receiving-foul there is an accepted offensive receiving foul;
13.2.2. turnovers-stall-out the [thrower](definition:thrower) has not released the pass before the [marker](definition:marker) first starts to say the word "ten" in the stall count (a "stall-out");
13.2.3. turnovers-handover the disc is intentionally transferred from one [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) to another without ever being completely untouched by both players (a "handover");
13.2.4. turnovers-deflection the [thrower](definition:thrower) intentionally deflects a pass to themselves off another [player](definition:player) (a "deflection");
13.2.5. turnovers-self-catch in attempting a pass, the [thrower](definition:thrower) catches the disc after release prior to the disc being contacted by another [player](definition:player) (a "self-catch");
13.2.6. turnovers-assist-movement an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) intentionally assists a team-mate's movement to [catch](definition:catch) a pass; or
13.2.7. turnovers-equipment-assist an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) uses an item of equipment or object to assist in catching a pass.
13.3. turnovers-call-contest If a [player](definition:player) determines a [turnover](definition:turnover) has occurred they must make the appropriate [call](definition:call) immediately. If the opposition disagrees they may call "contest" and [play](definition:play) must stop. If, after discussion, players cannot agree or it is unclear what occurred in the [play](definition:play), the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed [thrower](definition:thrower).
13.4. turnovers-stall-out-specifics After a "stall-out" [call](definition:call):
13.4.1. turnovers-fast-count-defense If the [thrower](definition:thrower) still has [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc), but they believe a fast count occurred in such a manner that they did not have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out, the [play](definition:play) is treated as either an accepted defensive breach (9.5.1) or a contested stall-out (9.5.3).
13.4.2. turnovers-completed-pass-contest If the [thrower](definition:thrower) made a completed pass, the [thrower](definition:thrower) can contest if they believe it was not a "stall-out", or there was a fast count immediately prior to the "stall-out".
13.4.3. turnovers-contest-incomplete-pass If the [thrower](definition:thrower) contests a stall-out but also attempts a pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the [turnover](definition:turnover) stands and [play](definition:play) restarts with a check.
13.5. turnovers-establish-possession Any [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) may establish [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) after a [turnover](definition:turnover), except:
13.5.1. turnovers-interception-maintain after an "[interception](definition:interception)" [turnover](definition:turnover), in which case the [player](definition:player) who made the [interception](definition:interception) must maintain [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc); and
13.5.2. turnovers-receiving-foul-establish after an accepted receiving foul caused by the offence, in which case the fouled [player](definition:player) must establish [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
13.6. turnovers-intentional-drop If the [player](definition:player) in [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) after a [turnover](definition:turnover), or after a [pull](definition:pull) that has already hit the [ground](definition:ground), intentionally drops the disc, places the disc on the [ground](definition:ground), or transfers [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc), they must re-establish [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) and restart [play](definition:play) with a check.
13.7. turnovers-location After a [turnover](definition:turnover), the turnover location is where:
13.7.1. turnovers-disc-stop the disc has come to a stop or is picked up by an [offensive player](definition:offensive-player); or
13.7.2. turnovers-intercepting-player the intercepting [player](definition:player) stops;
13.7.3. turnovers-thrower-location the [thrower](definition:thrower) was located at the time of the [call](definition:call), in the case of 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 13.2.4, 13.2.5; or
13.7.4. turnovers-offensive-player-location the [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) was located, in the case of 13.2.6 and 13.2.7; or
13.7.5. turnovers-receiving-foul-location the accepted offensive receiving foul occurred.
13.8. turnovers-out-of-bounds-pivot If the turnover location is [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), or the disc touched an [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) area after the [turnover](definition:turnover) occurred, the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point at the location on the [central zone](definition:central-zone) nearest to [where the disc went out-of-bounds](definition:where-the-disc-stops) (Section 11.8).
13.8.1. turnovers-pivot-alternatives If 13.8 does not apply, a pivot point must be established according to 13.9, 13.10, or 13.11.
13.9. turnovers-central-zone-pivot If the turnover location is in the [central zone](definition:central-zone), the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point at that location.
13.10. turnovers-attacking-endzone-pivot If the turnover location is in the offence's [attacking end zone](definition:attacking-end-zone), the [thrower](definition:thrower) must establish a pivot point at the nearest location on the [goal line](definition:goal-line).
13.11. turnovers-defending-endzone-choice If the turnover location is in the offence's [defending end zone](definition:defending-end-zone), the [thrower](definition:thrower) may choose where to establish a pivot point:
13.11.1. turnovers-stay-turnover-location at the turnover location, by staying at the turnover location or faking a pass; or
13.11.2. turnovers-goal-line-option at the nearest location on the [goal line](definition:goal-line) to the turnover location, by moving from the turnover location.
13.11.2.1. turnovers-signal-goal-line The intended [thrower](definition:thrower), before picking up the disc, may signal the [goal line](definition:goal-line) option by fully extending one arm above their head.
13.11.3. turnovers-movement-determines Immediate movement, staying at the turnover location, faking a pass, or signaling the [goal line](definition:goal-line) option, determines where to establish a pivot point and cannot be reversed.
13.12. turnovers-continued-unknowingly If, after an accepted [turnover](definition:turnover), [play](definition:play) has continued unknowingly, [play](definition:play) stops and the disc is returned to the turnover location, players resume their positions at the time the [turnover](definition:turnover) occurred and [play](definition:play) restarts with a check.
14. scoring-definition Scoring
14.1. scoring-goal-scored A goal is scored if an in-bounds [player](definition:player) catches a legal pass and:
14.1.1. scoring-ground-contacts all their [ground contacts](definition:ground-contact) are entirely within their [attacking end zone](definition:attacking-end-zone), or for an airborne [player](definition:player), all of their first simultaneous points of [ground contact](definition:ground-contact) after catching the disc are entirely within their [attacking end zone](definition:attacking-end-zone), and
14.1.2. scoring-establish-possession they subsequently establish [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc), and maintain the [catch](definition:catch) throughout all [ground contact](definition:ground-contact) related to the [catch](definition:catch) (note 12.1, 12.1.1).
14.2. scoring-goal-call If a [player](definition:player) believes a goal has been scored, they may call "goal" and [play](definition:play) stops. After a contested or retracted goal [call](definition:call) [play](definition:play) must restart with a check and the [call](definition:call) is deemed to have been made when the [player](definition:player) established [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
14.3. scoring-endzone-no-goal If a [player](definition:player) in [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc) ends up in the [end zone](definition:end-zone) they are attacking without scoring a goal according to 14.1, the [player](definition:player) must establish a pivot point at the nearest location on the [goal line](definition:goal-line).
14.4. scoring-goal-time The time at which a goal is deemed to have been scored is when the [player](definition:player) established [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
15. calling-fouls-infractions-violations Calling Fouls, Infractions and Violations
15.1. calling-foul-definition A breach of the rules due to non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) between two or more opposing players is a foul.
15.1.1. calling-minor-contact-violation A [player](definition:player) intentionally initiating [minor contact](definition:minor-contact) is still a breach of the rules, but is to be treated as a violation, and not a foul.
15.2. calling-infraction-definition A breach of the rules regarding a Marking or Travel breach is an infraction. Infractions do not stop [play](definition:play).
15.3. calling-violation-definition Every other breach of the rules is a violation.
15.4. calling-foul-only-fouled Only the [player](definition:player) fouled may claim a foul, by calling "Foul".
15.5. calling-infraction-thrower In general only the [thrower](definition:thrower) may claim an infraction, by calling the specific name of the infraction.
15.5.1. calling-infraction-exceptions However any [offensive player](definition:offensive-player) may call a double team, and any [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) may call a travel infraction.
15.6. calling-violation-opposing Any opposing [player](definition:player) may claim a violation, by calling the specific name of the violation or "Violation", unless specified otherwise by the particular rule.
15.7. calling-stop-play When a foul or violation [call](definition:call) is made that stops [play](definition:play), players must stop [play](definition:play) by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage as soon as they are aware of the [call](definition:call) and all players should echo calls on the field. If [play](definition:play) has stopped for a discussion without any [call](definition:call) having been made, a [call](definition:call) is deemed to have been made when the discussion started.
15.8. calling-immediate-recognition Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised.
15.9. calling-incorrect-stoppage After a [player](definition:player) initiates a stoppage incorrectly, including after mishearing a [call](definition:call), not knowing the rules, or not making the [call](definition:call) immediately:
15.9.1. calling-opposition-retains-possession if the opposition gains or retains [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), any subsequent [play](definition:play) stands.
15.9.2. calling-opposition-no-possession if the opposition does not gain or retain [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed [thrower](definition:thrower), unless 16.3 applies.
15.9.3. calling-stall-count-breach The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by the [player](definition:player) who initiated the stoppage incorrectly.

15.11. calling-retract If a [player](definition:player) making any [call](definition:call) subsequently determines that their [call](definition:call) was incorrect, they can retract the [call](definition:call), by calling "Retracted". [Play](definition:play) resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by that [player](definition:player).
15.12. calling-multiple-breaches If multiple breaches occur on the same [play](definition:play) or before [play](definition:play) stops, the outcomes should be resolved in reverse sequence (latest breach first, earliest breach last).
15.13. calling-hand-signals Players are encouraged to use the WFDF Hand Signals to communicate all calls.
16. continuation-after-call Continuation after a [Call](definition:call)
16.1. continuation-stop-immediately Whenever a foul or violation [call](definition:call) is made, or a [player](definition:player) attempts to stop [play](definition:play) in any way, [play](definition:play) stops immediately and no [turnover](definition:turnover) is possible (unless in situations specified in 15.9, 16.2, and 16.3).
16.2. continuation-play-continues If a foul or violation:
16.2.1. continuation-called-against-thrower is called against the [thrower](definition:thrower) and the [thrower](definition:thrower) attempts a pass, or
16.2.2. continuation-called-by-thrower is called by the [thrower](definition:thrower) during the act of throwing, or
16.2.3. continuation-disc-in-air is called or occurs when the disc is in the air,
then [play](definition:play) continues until [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) has been established.
16.2.4. continuation-possession-established Once [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) has been established:
16.2.4.1. continuation-calling-team-retains If the team that called the foul or violation gains or retains [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) as a result of the pass, the [play](definition:play) stands. [Play](definition:play) can continue without a stoppage if the [player](definition:player) who made the foul or violation [call](definition:call) makes a "Play on" [call](definition:call) as soon as possible.
16.2.4.2. continuation-calling-team-loses If the team that called the foul or violation does not gain or retain [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) as a result of the pass, [play](definition:play) must be stopped.
16.2.4.2.1. continuation-possession-affected If the team that called the foul or violation believes that [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) has been affected by the foul or violation, the disc will be returned to the [thrower](definition:thrower) for a check (unless the specific rule says otherwise).
16.3. continuation-no-effect Regardless of when any [call](definition:call) is made, if the players involved from both teams agree that the event or [call](definition:call) did not affect the outcome, the [play](definition:play) stands. This rule is not superseded by any other rule.
16.3.1. continuation-goal-stands If the [play](definition:play) resulted in a goal, the goal stands.
16.3.2. continuation-positional-disadvantage If the [play](definition:play) did not result in a goal the affected players may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the event or [call](definition:call) and restart [play](definition:play) with a check.
17. fouls-definition Fouls
17.1. fouls-dangerous-play Dangerous Play:
17.1.1. fouls-dangerous-actions Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of fellow players, or posing significant risk of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behaviours, are considered dangerous play and must be treated as a foul, regardless of whether or when contact occurs. This rule is not superseded by any other foul rule. If the dangerous play [call](definition:call) is accepted, this must be treated as the most relevant foul from Section 17.
17.2. fouls-receiving Receiving Fouls:
17.2.1. fouls-receiving-definition A Receiving Foul occurs when a [player](definition:player) initiates non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) with an opponent before, while, or directly after, either [player](definition:player) makes a play on the disc.
17.2.1.1. fouls-receiving-arms-hands Contact with an opponent's arms or hands, that occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the opponent can no longer make a play on the disc, is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but should be avoided (excluding contact related to Section 17.1 and 17.3).
17.2.2. fouls-receiving-possession After an accepted receiving foul the fouled [player](definition:player) gains [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc) at the location of the breach, even if that location is in an [end zone](definition:end-zone), and [play](definition:play) restarts with a check. If, after the check, 14.3 applies, the stall count can not be started until a pivot point is established at the nearest location on the [goal line](definition:goal-line). If the foul is contested, the disc is returned to the [thrower](definition:thrower).
17.3. fouls-strip Strip Fouls:
17.3.1. fouls-strip-definition A Strip Foul occurs when an opponent fouls a [player](definition:player) and that causes the [player](definition:player) to drop a disc they caught or to lose [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc).
17.3.2. fouls-strip-goal If the reception would have otherwise been a goal, and the foul is accepted, a goal is awarded.
17.4. fouls-blocking Blocking Fouls:
17.4.1. fouls-blocking-definition A Blocking Foul occurs when a [player](definition:player) takes a position that an opponent moving in a legal manner will be unable to avoid, taking into account the opponents expected position based on their established speed and direction, and non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) results. This is to be treated as either a receiving foul or an indirect foul, whichever is applicable.
17.5. fouls-force-out Force-out Fouls:
17.5.1. fouls-force-out-definition A Force-out Foul occurs when a receiver is in the process of establishing [possession of the disc](definition:possession-of-the-disc), and is fouled by a [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) before subsequently establishing [possession](definition:possession-of-the-disc), and the contact caused the receiver:
17.5.1.1. fouls-force-out-bounds to [catch](definition:catch) the disc [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob) instead of in-bounds; or
17.5.1.2. fouls-force-out-endzone to [catch](definition:catch) the disc in the [central zone](definition:central-zone) instead of their [attacking end zone](definition:attacking-end-zone).
17.5.2. fouls-force-out-goal If the receiver would have caught the disc in their [attacking end zone](definition:attacking-end-zone), it is a goal;
17.5.3. fouls-force-out-contested If the force-out foul is contested, the disc is returned to the [thrower](definition:thrower) if the receiver became [out-of-bounds](definition:out-of-bounds-ob), otherwise the disc stays with the receiver.
17.6. fouls-defensive-throwing Defensive Throwing (Marking) Fouls:
17.6.1. fouls-defensive-throwing-definition A Defensive Throwing Foul occurs when:
17.6.1.1. fouls-defensive-illegal-positioning There is non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) between the [thrower](definition:thrower) and an illegally positioned [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) (Section 18.1); or
17.6.1.2. fouls-defensive-contact A [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) initiates non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) with the [thrower](definition:thrower), or there is non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) resulting from the [thrower](definition:thrower) and the defender both vying for the same unoccupied position, prior to the [thrower](definition:thrower) releasing the pass.
17.6.1.3. fouls-defensive-contact-infraction If a Defensive Throwing Foul occurs prior to the [thrower](definition:thrower) releasing the pass and not during the [throwing motion](definition:throwing-motion), the [thrower](definition:thrower) may choose to call a contact infraction, by calling "Contact". After a contact infraction that is not contested, [play](definition:play) does not stop and the [marker](definition:marker) must resume the stall count at one (1).
17.7. fouls-offensive-throwing Offensive Throwing (Thrower) Fouls:
17.7.1. fouls-offensive-throwing-definition An Offensive Throwing Foul occurs when the [thrower](definition:thrower) is solely responsible for initiating non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) with a [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) who is in a legal position.
17.7.2. fouls-offensive-follow-through Contact occurring during the [thrower's](definition:thrower) follow through is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but should be avoided.
17.8. fouls-indirect Indirect Fouls:
17.8.1. fouls-indirect-definition An Indirect Foul occurs when there is non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) between a receiver and a [defensive player](definition:defensive-player) that does not directly affect an attempt to make a play on the disc.
17.8.1.1. fouls-indirect-delay Prior to making the "Indirect Foul" [call](definition:call), the [player](definition:player) may delay the [call](definition:call) up to two (2) seconds to determine if the breach will [affect the play](definition:affect-the-play).
17.8.2. fouls-indirect-positional If the foul is accepted the fouled [player](definition:player) may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the foul.
17.9. fouls-offsetting Offsetting Fouls:
17.9.1. fouls-offsetting-definition If accepted fouls are called by offensive and defensive players on the same [play](definition:play), these are offsetting fouls, and the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed [thrower](definition:thrower).
17.9.2. fouls-offsetting-simultaneous If there is non-[minor contact](definition:minor-contact) that is caused by two or more opposing players moving towards a single point simultaneously, this must be treated as offsetting fouls.
17.9.2.1. fouls-offsetting-after-catch However if this occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the relevant [player/s](definition:player) involved can no longer make a play on the disc, this must be treated as an Indirect Foul (excluding contact related to Section 17.1).
18. infractions-violations Infractions and Violations
18.1. infractions-marking Marking Infractions:
18.1.1. infractions-marking-types Marking infractions include the following:
18.1.1.1. infractions-fast-count "Fast Count" – the [marker](definition:marker):
18.1.1.1.1. infractions-fast-count-illegal starts or continues the stall count illegally,
18.1.1.1.2. infractions-fast-count-stalling does not start or restart the stall count with "Stalling",
18.1.1.1.3. infractions-fast-count-intervals counts in less than one second intervals,
