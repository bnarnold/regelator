Once a [player](definition:player) has established possession, they may change their grip on the disc and that does not affect their possession, as long as they maintain contact with the disc.

A disc in the possession of a [player](definition:player), or caught by a [player](definition:player), is considered part of that [player](definition:player).

A pass is the equivalent of a [throw](definition:throw).

Throwing motion: The throwing motion is the motion that transfers momentum from the [thrower](definition:thrower) to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a [throw](definition:throw). [Pivots](definition:pivot) and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
Turnover: Any event resulting in a change of the team in possession. A [turnover](definition:turnover) is not considered a violation.
