### Fundamental Access Barriers
- Rules PDF nearly impossible to find through search or website navigation (All Stories)
- Mobile PDF experience completely unusable - no search, terrible zoom/scroll, constantly lose place (All Stories)

- New players remain confused and make repeated mistakes due to learning barriers (Nathan Stories 1, 2, 3)
- Federation unable to effectively educate community due to fundamental access problems (Fred Stories 7, 8, 9)

### Zero Analytics or Feedback
- No digital platform means zero data about player rule access needs (Fred Story 7)
