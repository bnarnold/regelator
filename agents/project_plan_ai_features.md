# Project Plan: AI Features & Content Enhancement

This document tracks the development of AI-powered features for intelligent rule content processing and user assistance.

## Phase Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

## Epic Overview

**Who**: Fred (federation coordinator), Valeria (experienced player), Nathan (new player)  
**What**: AI-powered content processing, automatic cross-referencing, and intelligent rule assistance  
**Why**: Automate tedious content curation tasks and provide intelligent assistance for rule comprehension

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Simple RAG Over Complex GraphRAG
**Decision**: Use traditional RAG with SQLite FTS instead of GraphRAG  
**Rationale**: Ultimate Frisbee rules dataset is small (~500KB, 250 entities). GraphRAG adds $21K-48K in complexity costs over 3 years for minimal benefit.

**Simple Approach TCO (3-year)**: $10K-18K  
**GraphRAG TCO (3-year)**: $31K-66K  
**Premium not justified**: 10x cost increase for 500KB dataset with existing structured relationships

### Right-Sized AI Integration
**Focus on high-value, low-complexity features**:
- Content processing assistance (one-time tasks)
- Simple rule Q&A with existing cross-references
- Manual content curation with AI suggestions

**Avoid over-engineering**:
- No semantic graph construction for 250 entities
- No community detection for well-structured rule hierarchy
- No complex vector similarity when rule numbers + hierarchy work better
